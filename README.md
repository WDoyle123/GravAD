## Info

GravAD offers a cutting-edge approach to gravitational wave detection, leveraging Automatic Differentiation (AD), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), and [Ripple](https://github.com/tedwards2412/ripple) for template generation via IMRPhenomD. GravAD quickly pinpoints potential gravitational wave events in detector data by optimising the matched filtering process. Despite using fewer templates and significantly reducing computational time, it achieves nearly equivalent results to the established LIGO pipelines. This efficiency positions GravAD as an ideal preliminary tool in gravitational wave research, quickly sifting through data to highlight promising candidates for detailed analysis. GravAD also serves as an additional validator to existing search pipelines, fortifying their credibility.
